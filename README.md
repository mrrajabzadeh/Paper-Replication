# Table 1 Results Replication

This project is focused on replicating the Table 1 results of the paper "Style investing, comovement and return predictability" by Sunil Wahal and M. Deniz Yavuz, published in the Journal of Financial Economics 107 (2013) 136â€“154. The code performs comprehensive data handling, processing, and regression analysis to explore stock style investing, comovement, and return predictability.

## Overview

The code aims to:
- Fetch and prepare stock price data from the CRSP database using SQL queries.
- Process data to calculate market equity and book-to-market ratios.
- Create portfolio returns based on quintiles for size and B/M ratio.
- Conduct Fama-MacBeth regression analyses to predict future returns based on past performance metrics and style returns.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes the WRDS database to retrieve stock data and delisting returns from the CRSP database for the period between 1965 and 2009.
- **Data Processing**: Filters data, merges multiple datasets, and calculates key financial indicators like market equity and book-to-market ratios.
- **Portfolio Returns Calculation**: Groups stocks into quintiles based on size and B/M ratio and calculates returns for these portfolios.
- **Regression Analysis**: Runs multiple Fama-MacBeth regressions using various combinations of past returns, style returns, and financial metrics as independent variables to predict future returns.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you need access to Python and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `wrds`
- `linearmodels`
- `scipy`

Additionally, you will need a valid WRDS account to fetch data from their databases.

## File Structure

- `replication_script.py`: Main Python script containing all the code to perform the data fetching, processing, regression analysis, and output generation.
- `CCM.csv`: An external CSV file containing Compustat-CRSP Merged (CCM) dataset links needed for the analysis.
- `regression_results_Final.txt`: Output file where the regression analysis results are saved.
- `cc.csv`: Final processed dataset saved after all calculations and before regression analysis.

## Usage

1. **Set up environment**: Ensure Python and all dependencies are installed, and you have a WRDS account set up.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the `replication_script.py` to perform the analysis.
3. **Review results**: Check the `regression_results_Final.txt` for regression outputs and `cc.csv` for the processed data.
